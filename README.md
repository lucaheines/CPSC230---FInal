# CPSC230---FInal
My final Project

This final took a lot of time and research, the code used in this final was written by me, however was heavily influenced by research online. This project was difficult, and somewhat out of my range and skill, however I used research to help me complete this task. I installed Ultralytics(uses YOLOv8) on Python version 3.11.6, to complete this project. In the future I would like to make a script using only basic python functions, pandas, opencv, and maybe a few math based libraries. Also training my own dataset to detect more specific objects. Overall this is all very new to me, and I am trying my very best to learn!!!!!!!
